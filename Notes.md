# Uniswap V3

- this is will be a little different from working with V2
- that is because uniswap V3 has what is called 'focused liquidity', when you add liquidity to a pool you decide the price range where your liquidity will live.

- we will also install some additional packages:
    - v3-sdk
    - sdk-core
